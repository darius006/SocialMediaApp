# A Twitter-like web application using ASP.NET Core
Group project for DAW class, year 2025-2026.
The web application uses Entity Framework and SQL Server along with other packages. It is a collaborative project between me and [a-violeta](https://github.com/a-violeta/SocialMediaApp). The workload has been split evenly ensuring both of us have worked frontend and backend. It uses the MVC model. The `Agile` methodology was used during the making of the project, the tasks were split into 4 sprints and documented on `trello`. For more details checkout `Proiecte_Laborator (1).pdf`.
